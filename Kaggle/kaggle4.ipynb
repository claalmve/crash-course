    "# SUSA CX Kaggle Capstone Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Woohoo! You've made it to the end of the CX Kaggle Capstone Project! Congratulations on all of your hard work so far. We hope you've enjoyed this opportunity to learn new modeling techniques, some underlying mathematics, and even make new friends within CX. At this point, we've covered the entirety of the Data Science Workflow, linear regression, feature engineering, PCA, shrinkage, hyperparameter tuning, decision trees and even ensemble models. This week, we're going to finish off this whirlwind tour with a revisit to our old friend, Deep Learning. While the MNIST digit dataset was really interesting to look at as a cool toy example of the powers of DL, this time you're going to apply neural networks to your housing dataset for some hands-on practice using Keras. \n",
    "\n",
    "> ### CX Kaggle Competition & Final Kaggle Evaluation\n",
    "After you get some practice with deep learning, this week we will be asking you and your team to select and finalize your best model, giving you the codespace to write up your finalized model and evaluate it by officially submitting your results to Kaggle. The winners of this friendly collab-etition will be honored at the SUSA Banquet next Friday, including prizes for the winning team! We also want to encourage and facilitate discussion between teams on why different models performed differently, and give you a chance to chat with other teams about their own experiences with the CX Kaggle Capstone. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Logistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the logistics are the same as last week, but we are repeating them here for your convenience. Please let us know if you or your teammates are feeling nervous about the pace of this project - remember that we are not grading you on your project, and we really try to make the notebooks relatively easy and fast to code through. If for any reason you are feeling overwhelmed or frustrated, please DM us or talk to us in person. We want all of you to have a productive, healthy, and fun time learning data science! If you have any suggestions or recommendations on how to improve, please do not hesitate to reach out!\n",
    "\n",

    "### Mandatory Office Hours\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is such a large project, you and your team will surely have to work on it outside of meetings. In order to get you guys to seek help from this project, we are making it **mandatory** for you and your group to attend **two (2)** SUSA Office Hours over the next 4 weeks. This will allow questions to be answered outside of the regular meetings and will help promote collaboration with more experienced SUSA members.\n",
    "\n",
    "The schedule of SUSA office hours are below:\n",
    "https://susa.berkeley.edu/calendar#officehours-table\n",
    "\n",
    "We understand that most of you will end up going to Arun or Patrick's office hours, but we highly encourage you to go to other people's office hours as well. There are many qualified SUSA mentors who can help and this could be an opportunity for you to meet them.\n",

However, you did not realize that she is actually an alien and her house is filled with very strange objects. When you head to bed, you attempt to use her shower, but see that her shower is has a dozen of knobs that control the temperature of the water coming out! We only have a single output to work off of, but many different knobs or *parameters* to adjust. If the water is too hot, we can turn random knobs until it becomes cold, and learn a bit about our environment. We may determine that some knobs are more or less sensitive, just like hyperparameters. Each knob in the shower is equivalent to a hyperparameter we can tune in a model.\n",

Congratulations on graduating from the SUSA Career Exploration committee! It's been a wonderful experience teaching you all, and we hope you got as much out of CX as we did this semester. This semester brought several new pilot programs to CX, such as the crash courses, workbooks, a revamped curriculum, and the CX Kaggle Capstone Project. You all have been great sources of feedback, and we want to make next semester's CX curriculum even better for the new generation of CX! \n",

Please fill out [this feedback form](https://goo.gl/forms/VteqJ5Di84t54TEZ2) and let us know how we could have done better. Thank you again for a wonderful semester, and we will see you again in the Fall!\n",
